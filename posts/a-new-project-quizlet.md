I had not touched a single bit of code basically since the year started and I had been longing to make something with React, thus I settled on making this.

It is currently live at https://quizlet.aktindo.vercel.app (yes, a default domain since my original one expired)

## Idea
I wanted to see how I can manipulate an API's data and present it on the frontend, and the best way I thought to do that, was this. 
Basically when you open the site, you are presented with a total of 5 random questions from the internet. Provided that you have 4 options for each one, you have to attempt them to obtain a score out of 5.

The design system is quite simple as well, most of it using the wonderful daisyUI (a plugin for tailwindcss).

## Conclusion
The logic behind this stuff took me some time to figure out, since it was a completely new thing I had ever made. And I'm surprised it turned out pretty well!
With this, I'm gonna end this post and expect more at the end of the year!

Cheers
