## The Beginning

Today, ~~we~~ I am introducing **Aktindo Blog**. A place where I can post stuff about my development journey and more!

By the way, this app that you are on right now, reading this blog, is **not** available to the public. It was made by me and for my specific use, so don't spam that question in the comments below. There are a lot of things planned throughout 2021, so stay tuned for any update!

The code for this blog is available at https://github.com/aktindo/blog! Share your opinions in the comments below and don't forget to like this post (or imma smash you).

Here's a `codeblock`

```js
console.log("hi im aktindo");
```

**why?** you may ask, well I need to finish this blog with some big chunk of text and I have nothing to write.

This was a pretty short blog but expect more coming soon!
